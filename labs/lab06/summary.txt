I was able to use some of the methods learned during this course.
I started tge script recording using the script command.
I was able to use the wget command to get a file from a location on the internet.
I moved that file to a new directory and unzipped it.
I used Globstar to show the .ini files and grep command to find a particular string of text.
I was abke to count lines and output them to a different file.
After writing this summary I am interested in how it all looks in the script record.  I messed up plenty.
I feel I will get more expeienced as I progress and use Linux more often.:
